# GitHub Classic PAT Scraper

This project contains a Python script to scrape Classic Personal Access Tokens from your GitHub settings page (`https://github.com/settings/tokens`).

## Purpose
To help identify and inventory classic Personal Access Tokens (PATs) as part of a security initiative. Classic PATs have broad permissions and do not offer the same level of control as Fine-grained PATs, making them a higher security risk. This script is designed to be run by individual users on their own accounts to report on their classic tokens.
